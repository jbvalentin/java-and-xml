	<notes>Initially establishing his reputation as a composer of works in the romantic vein of Weber and Meyerbeer, 
	Wagner revolutionised opera through his concept of the <b>Gesamtkunstwerk</b> ("<i>total work of art</i>"), by 
	which he sought to synthesise the poetic, visual, musical and dramatic arts, with music subsidiary to drama.</notes>
